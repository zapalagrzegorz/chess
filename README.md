Open App Academy's Chess [project](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/ruby/chess--part-one-)

## Learning Goals

* Know when and why private methods are used
* Be able to read UML and understand the benefits of UML
* Be familiar with how to use the Singleton module
* Know how to use modules
* Know how class inheritance works

## Phase I: Board

Your Board class should hold a 2-dimensional array (an array of arrays). Each position in the board either holds a moving Piece or a NullPiece (NullPiece will inherit from Piece).

There are many different kinds of pieces in chess, and each moves a specific way. Based on their moves, they can be placed in four categories:

0. Sliding pieces (Bishop/Rook/Queen)
1. Stepping pieces (Knight/King)
2. Null pieces (occupy the 'empty' spaces)
3. Pawns (we'll do this class last)

To start off, you'll want to create an empty Piece class as a placeholder for now. Write code for #initialize so we can setup the board with instances of Piece in locations where a Queen/Rook/Knight/ etc. will start and nil where the NullPiece will start.

The Board class should have a #move_piece(start_pos, end_pos) method. This should update the 2D grid and also the moved piece's position. You'll want to raise an exception if:

0. there is no piece at start_pos or
1. the piece cannot move to end_pos.

Time to test! Open up pry and load 'board.rb'. Create an instance of Board and check out different positions with board[pos]. Do you get back Piece instances where you expect to? Test out Board#move_piece(start_pos, end_pos), does it raise an error when there is no piece at the start? Does it successfully update the Board?

Once you get some of your pieces moving around the board, call over your TA for a code-review.

## Phase II: Pieces

Lets populate the Piece parent class that contains the functionality common to all pieces. A key method of Piece is #moves, which should return an array of places a Piece can move to. Of course, every piece will move differently, so you can't write (implement) the #moves method of Piece without subclasses.

NB You will not implement tricky moves like "en passant". Don't implement castling, draws, or pawn promotion either. You will handle check and check mate, however.

You should make modules for Slideable and Stepable. The Slideable module can implement #moves, but it needs to know what directions a piece can move in (diagonal, horizontally/vertically, both). Classes that include the module Slideable (Bishop/Rook/Queen) will need to implement a method #move_dirs, which #moves will use.

Your Piece will need to (1) track its position and (2) hold a reference to the Board. Classes that include Slideable in particular need the Board so they know to stop sliding when blocked by another piece. Don't allow a piece to move into a square already occupied by the same color piece, or to move a sliding piece past a piece that blocks it.

The NullPiece class should include the singleton module. It will not need a reference to the Board - in fact its initialize method should take no arguments. Make sure you have a way to read its color and symbol.

Lastly, make your Pawn class. Be sure to use the Chess UML Diagram to guide you on what methods and instance variables to define for this class!

After completing each piece load the file in pry and make sure it moves properly. Once you have completed all pieces refactor your Board#initialize so that all your pieces are placed in their respective starting positions.

Time to test! Open up pry and load 'board.rb'. Create an instance of Board and check out different positions with board[pos]. Do you get back instances of the type of pieces you expect? Can you move the pieces around?

For now, do not worry if a move leaves a player in check.

Once you are finished with phases I & II head over to Part Two.
